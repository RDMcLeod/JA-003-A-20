# JA-003-A-20

Currently Working on the Maze Part Deux .  3 Things I was able to get the first set working ad run but had to terminate the run.  Adding the other position has lead to out of bound condition/problem that I am working on Dec 16 2020  Happy Holidays

Dec 16 2020 commit - Still having issues with the Github clock not matching my system clock off by 1 day currently EST Toronto, but not sure if that is a segment or a whole 24 hrs.  I am commiting this file on Dec 16 2020 but Github profile reads Dec 15 2020.  Could cause major issues in the future.  Not a power user yet, but will be MMW's

Dec 27 2020 - having and issue with a (Integer::parseInt) and it is causing me errors keeping the code from running
